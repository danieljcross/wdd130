<h1 class="why_stay_here">Why should I stay here? Is this the right place for our group?</h1>
<p class="why_stay_here" id="p_1">This is run completely by our family. You will find us to be very reasonable and down to earth. We want you to have a great trip, which is why we provide so many of these entertainment options. This really is a great house and in a great location.<br><br>There are many bedrooms, and tons of open gathering space. We ourselves bought it primarily for our own family gatherings. This is also a great place for work or school retreats. There are rooms both upstairs and downstairs which can allow for easy division for co-ed groups. If there is another reason you might have for staying here, let us know! We would love to accommodate for more needs.</p>
