      <p>
      Why should I stay here? 
      </p>
      <p>
      This is run completely by our family. You will find us to be very reasonable and down to earth. We want you to have a great trip, which is why we provide so many of these entertainment options. This really is a great house and in a great location. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this the right place for our group?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many bedrooms, and tons of open gathering space. We ourselves bought it primarily for our own family gatherings. This is also a great place for work or school retreats. There are rooms both upstairs and downstairs which can allow for easy division for co-ed groups. If there is another reason you might have for staying here, let us know! We would love to accommodate for more needs.

      <h3>Rooms and Entertainment</h3>
      <p>
        How many rooms are there, and what furniture, appliances, or entertainment are included?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are seven bedrooms and six bathrooms (four with showers). The main floor consists of the "Great Room," which has four couches, two long oak dining tables, an electric grand piano, and a huge flat screen TV. These are all movable, allowing for personalized decoration and set up. The main floor also has both a kitchen and a serving area. The upstairs has a TV as well, along with a large sectional couch. The downstairs has a recreation room with a ping pong table and billiards, as well as a movie theater room with twelve individual reclining chairs. It has its own kitchen. There are also many outdoor features, like a pickleball court, hot tub, large amphitheater, basketball hoop, volleyball net, playground, and plenty of grass for kids to run around on.

      <h3>Other Entertainment</h3>
      <p>
        What is there to do in the area? How far will we have to drive?
      </p>
      <p>
        There is plenty to do right here in Blackfoot, all within 10 minutes of the house. This includes Jensens Grove Park, great local restaurants, the Idaho Potato Museum, the Movie Mill, and a boating dock to the Snake River. About half an hour away are Idaho Falls and Pocatello, which have all sorts of entertainment options by themselves. An hour drive will get you Lava Hot Springs, Pebble Creek Ski Area, or Kelly Canyon Ski Resort. Within a couple of hours you can get to Island Park, St. Anthony Sand Dunes, Shoshone Falls, Grand Teton National Park, and Yellowstone National Park.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The bottom two titles and pictures will be links to those pages. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/Home Page.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>         
        Each row will represent the different floors of the house. A hover over each of the middle pictures will reveal either four or six other images from that floor. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/Page 1.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        An image collage will make up that top part before the list. Those images will be of places to go in the area.
